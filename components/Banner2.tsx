        <p>
          Every 5 days, a child in Sarawak is diagnosed with cancer. Childhood
          cancer can be curable, but the journey is not an easy one. <br />
          <br />
          The Sarawak Childrenâ€™s Cancer Society (SCCS) helps these children and
          their families through much-needed support services, all of which are
          possible through funds from the public. <br />
          <br />
          Join us in our mission to provide relief and care for childhood cancer
          patients
